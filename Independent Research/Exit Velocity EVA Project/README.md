This folder contains code for a project that aims to show the difference in batting power between teams and leagues within baseball.

Using Extreme Value Analysis, a confidence interval for each league's expected top exit velocity on balls in play will be determined. This project will use Peak-Over-Threshold method to determine the qualifiers for a "high-EV" ball in play.

The project will also analyze MLB teams to determine which team to watch out for if a fan is looking for high power in their MLB viewing experience.
