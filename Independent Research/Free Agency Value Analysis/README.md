This project will investigate how well MLB teams were at gaining value in free agency from the 2011-12 offseason through the 2021-22 offseason.

The analysis will determine the true value of a Baseball Reference WAR by using web-scraped BBRef data containing the previous 3-year bWAR for each free agent. 
Then, the contract each free agent received (web-scraped from ESPN) will be used to determine how much better the WAR-based return was compared to the cost.

The end result of this project will be R visuals and a Tableau dashboard summarizing findings.
