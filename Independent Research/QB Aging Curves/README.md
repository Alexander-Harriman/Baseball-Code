This folder contains code that creates an advanced aging curve for ESPN's Quarterback Rating (QBR), Passer Rating, Adjusted Net Yards Per Attempt (ANY/A), and Completion%. The curve uses data from the 2010-2022 seasons.

Each player's 2023 performance was normalized to the 2023 NFL league average. Then, the aging curves were used to create an expected performance for each 2023 QB to determine who overachieved and who underachieved the most.

The ultimate goal is to create a baseline prediction for each QB's statistics ahead of the 2024 NFL season, which will be tracked throughout the year for the same purpose as 2023's baseline.

A dashboard was created with the findings from this analysis, which can be found here: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexander.harriman4059/viz/2023NFLQBAdvancedAnalysis/PlayerMetrics]
