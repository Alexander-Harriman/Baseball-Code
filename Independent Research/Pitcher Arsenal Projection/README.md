This project takes AAA pitcher data and creates a report on their arsenals. The report in Tableau will include the following:

- A table showing average pitch movement for each pitch
- A table showing performance by pitch
- A heat map of locations for each pitch type

The project will also look at the difference between the pitching environment in each AAA league and project how the pitcher's arsenal would look if he was dropped into the MLB.
The movement profile will then be compared to pitchers who pitched for the MLB club in 2024 as a way of showing who is ready for a promotion.
