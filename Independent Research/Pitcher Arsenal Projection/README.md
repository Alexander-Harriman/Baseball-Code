This project takes AAA pitcher data and creates a report on their arsenals. The report in Tableau will include the following:

- A table showing average pitch movement for each pitch
- A table showing performance by pitch
- A heat map of locations for each pitch type

The project will also look at the difference between the pitching environment in each AAA league and project how the pitcher's arsenal would look if he was dropped into the MLB.
This analysis will analyze pitchers who threw 50 of a single pitch type in both the 2023 AAA and 2023 MLB seasons. A weighted difference between the AAA and MLB metrics will be a baseline adjustment for AAA to MLB pitch profiling.
Once the differences between levels are determined, each 2024 AAA pitcher's arsenal will be adjusted by the expected arsenal variation value.
The MLB-adjusted movement profile will then be compared to pitchers who pitched for the MLB club in 2024 to show who is ready for a promotion.
