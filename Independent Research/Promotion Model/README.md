This folder contains files for a minor league player promotion model project. 

Performance from the 2022 and 2023 Pro Baseball seasons (Dominican Summer League, Arizona/Florida Leagues, Full-Season MiLB, and MLB) will be used alongside when they were promoted to predict if 2024 players will be promoted.

The model will contain performance metrics for that season. Other data will be added as necessary to improve performance.
