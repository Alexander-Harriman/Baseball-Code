This folder contains code for a project that aims to show the difference in batting power between teams in MLB.

Extreme Value Analysis will determine a confidence interval for each team's expected top exit velocity on balls in play. This project will use Peak-Over-Threshold method to determine the qualifiers for a "high-EV" ball in play.

The project will use data from the past three MLB seasons to determine which teams have had the most muscle at the plate. Then, an analysis into each team's AAA affiliate will be used to determine which MLB teams have had the most power coming through their minor league pipeline, along with who has developed or acquired extra power compared to their AAA team.
